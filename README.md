🚀 Agentic AI Labs – Jonathan Marx

Welcome to my personal repository for the DeepLearning.AI Agentic AI course series.
This repo documents my work as I build practical agent-based systems using:

LLM-driven code generation

Reflection-based agents

Autonomous workflows

Multi-model reasoning (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Tavily)

Each lab folder contains a complete, reproducible agentic workflow including code, charts, utilities, and documentation.
